# Cloaked Warfare
The ultimate deck-building battleship game.

## Cards
There are many different types of cards, such as ammo cards, weapon cards, and utility cards. They can be bought and added to your deck, and have many purposes.

### Weapons
Weapons simply allow you to fire at your enemies, and have unique stats that set them apart from each other

### Ammo
Ammunition can be loaded into weapons to add special abilities and modifiers to the weapons.

### Utilities
Utilities can boost your ships and/or weapons in various ways. They can help defend your ships or buff your weapons

### Modules
Weapons and Utilities are installed into your ships on module slots, which all ships have, just in different amounts

## Game Modes
There two main gamemodes: singleplayer and multiplayer. This game supports networked multiplayer across networks, but port forwarding is required by the host. To counteract this, you can play the gotm.io version of the game. Singleplayer is played with you against the AI. Game rules can also be customized to change gameplay.
